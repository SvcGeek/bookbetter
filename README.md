This website is an exercise to support the Public Speaking course.

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the preparation for the oral presentation in the Public Speaking course. The main task was to present a solution for a new booking portal (similar to booking.com) on behalf of Blazar Group, the company I work for.

The focus of the presentation was to design a user interface (UI) distinct from competitors, leveraging the psychology of colors to welcome clients, guide them, and increase conversion rates.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (via Tailwind CSS CDN)
- JavaScript (via CDN)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
